## Matching Game 'Lion King'

As a weekend project I built this matching game using jQuery and Bootstrap. Overall it was a simple way to learn new jQuery and jQuery UI features as well as Bootstrap CSS and JS features.

**Instructions:** Click on the tiles, a match will stay visible, a non-match will fade out and after matching all tiles you will be declared the winner. 

### Future Updates
* New tile themes
* Difficult mode with more tiles

### Inspired by...
*I built this game with my 2 little nephews in mind. They love the Lion King and they love playing on the ipad. I hope they enjoy playing this game.*
